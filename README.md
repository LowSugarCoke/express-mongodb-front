# Express MongoDB Front

This repository contains the code for a simple user registration and login system built with the following technologies:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Back-end: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. You can download the latest versions of Node.js and MongoDB from their respective websites.

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can clone this repository and install the required packages by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/LowSugarCoke/express_mongodb_front.git
cd express_mongodb_front
npm install
```

After the packages have been installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server and make the application available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the registration and login forms on the home page.

## Usage

To use the application, simply enter a username and password in the registration form and click the "Register" button. This will create a new user in the database and redirect you to the login page.

On the login page, enter your username and password and click the "Login" button. If your credentials are valid, you will be redirected to a "Welcome" page. If your credentials are invalid, you will be shown an error message.
